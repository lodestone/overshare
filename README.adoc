= Overshare

_**Work In Progress**_

_Overshare is a crystal app that works a bit like Droplr. You send Overshare a file or url and you get back a shortened link. This is designed to be run on your own server to ensure files and urls you share are private. Overshare will also automatically convert markdown and Asciidoc into html. Overshare is written in Crystal, so it's pretty fast._

== Examples:

=== Save a url:

```bash
curl -F "endpoint=http://news.ycombinator.com" "http://user:pass@host/-"
{"message":"Created","url":"http://host/-byczr0"}
```

=== Save a file:

```bash
curl -F "endpoint=@path/to/file.md" "http://user:pass@host/-"
{"message":"Created","url":"http://host/-ab723i"}
```
